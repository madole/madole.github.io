About a month ago, we decided to use SASS on our side project because we wanted to learn some of the new ways to 
pre-process CSS. I have used LESS before (which is a Node.js preprocessor) in a work project so it makes sense
to use something different for this learning experience. We then boiled down the choices to just two, SASS or Stylus. 
<!--more--> 
We chose SASS and I got down to doing some research. I learned it was built on Ruby, I also learned that a lot of people 
who use SASS also use Compass as it provides a bunch of mixins that are pretty handy when you come to writing 
your SASS. We wanted to use Bootstrap but at that point we weren't aware of the Bootstrap-SASS port, and it was only officially
written in CSS and LESS. 

I had looked into using SASS alongside the CSS version of Bootstrap but then one day when browsing GitHub, I came 
across the Bootstrap-SASS official port. 
Another layer of complexity to this learning experience but sure where's the fun if you're not jumping in at the deep end. 

I decided that as I was researching how to get set up with Compass, SASS and Bootstrap SASS for the first time,
I would document it in a presentation form. This as a) for me because my memory is terrible and b) for my team mates
so they wouldn't have to make the mistakes I did. 

I've included this presentation in a PDF format below so take a look, have a play about and leave me some feedback so
I can make this as useful as possible for others just starting out with these tools too

I’m 27, I write code for a job, and I write code for fun!

I started off as a Java developer but now I mainly use Javascript.

Node.js has taken my interest over the last period and highly recommend [Node School](http://nodeschool.io).
I’m pretty keen on EmberJS too. I have used AngularJS before and found it really interesting as it was my 
first attempt at using that style of JS framework.

For a while, I’ve been trying to find the appeal to CoffeeScript so I spent some time writing sorting algorithms in it to see what I could learn. It’s actually a pretty cool abstraction from javascript and although it might generate verbose code, it’s really quick to knock up a small prototype of something in CoffeeScript! That’s where I see its value!

Next on the list of learning is TypeScript!

{% img right ../images/me.jpg 300 300 me %}  

Iâ€™m 28, I write code for a job, and I write code for fun!

I started off as a Java and C# developer but now I'm mainly a full stack JavaScript developer. 

This blog is a notepad where I collect my findings so I can refer to them later, the posts might help you out as well as future me. 

You can find me in the following places:
